                    <strong>Assess symptom patterns and lung function.</strong> If features are consistent with asthma and lung function is variable, the diagnosis is supported.

                <FlowStep>
                    If evidence is still not definitive, consider <strong>stepping down the controller treatment.</strong> Find the lowest effective dose that maintains control.
                </FlowStep>
                <FlowStep>
                    If the patient is on low-dose controller, consider <strong>stopping the controller completely.</strong> This should be done with caution and close supervision.

                <FlowStep>
                    <strong>Measure FEV1 before and after stopping treatment.</strong> A significant decrease after cessation (<TrendingDown size={14} className="text-red-600"/>) and improvement on restarting (<TrendingUp size={14} className="text-emerald-600"/>) confirms the diagnosis.
                </FlowStep>
                <FlowStep>
                    If symptoms do not recur and lung function remains stable after stopping the controller for 2-4 weeks, the diagnosis of asthma is unlikely.

                                This is the most easily recognized asthma phenotype, which often commences in childhood and is associated with a past and/or family history of allergic disease such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, or food or drug allergy. Examination of the sputum of these patients before treatment often reveals eosinophilic airway inflammation.

                                Some adults have asthma that is not associated with allergy. The sputum of these patients may be eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or contain only a few inflammatory cells (paucigranulocytic). Patients with non-allergic asthma often respond less well to inhaled corticosteroids.

                                Some adults, particularly women, present with asthma for the first time in adult life. These patients tend to be non-allergic, and often require higher doses of ICS or are relatively refractory to corticosteroid treatment.

                                Some patients with long-standing asthma develop fixed airflow limitation that is thought to be due to airway remodeling. These patients have reduced reversibility to bronchodilator despite treatment with oral corticosteroids.
